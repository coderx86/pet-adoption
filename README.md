# Peddy - Pet Adoption Platform

The project is a pet adoption website, "Peddy," designed to connect pets in need of homes with prospective adopters. The platform allows users to browse and filter available pets by type (Cats, Dogs, Rabbits, Birds) and provides detailed information about each pet, including breed, birth date, gender, and adoption price. The site emphasizes ease of use with features like sorting by price and quick access to adoption or details pages for each pet. It also includes a subscription option for updates and contact information for customer support.

## Key features

Here are five key features of the "Peddy" pet adoption platform:

 - **Pet Filtering**: Users can filter pets by type, such as cats, dogs, rabbits, and birds.
 -  **Detailed Pet Profiles**: Each pet listing includes breed, birth date, gender, and adoption price.
 -  **Sorting Option**: Pets can be sorted by price for easier browsing.
 -  **Liked Pets Section**: Users can view a separate section for pets they have liked.
 -  **Adoption and Details Buttons**: Quick access to adopt or view more details about each pet.

## ES6 features used

The "Peddy" project uses several ES6 features, including:

 - **Arrow Functions**: For concise function syntax, as seen in `loadCategories`, `loadPets`, and more.
 - **Template Literals**: Used for HTML string interpolation, especially in `imageInserter` and `displayDetail`.
 - **Let and Const**: For block-scoped and immutable variable declarations across the codebase​
 - **`for...of` Loop**: For iterating over elements like category buttons and making modifications, such as removing classes in
   `removeActiveClass`.
 - **`forEach` Method**: It enhances iteration over arrays, enabling easy manipulation of elements, such as in `displayPets`.
 - **Function Body**: This method data fetching from APIs, dynamic content rendering for pet profiles, user interaction management with
   event handling, conditional logic for UI updates, and state
   management for loading indicators, all contributing to a seamless
   user experience.
